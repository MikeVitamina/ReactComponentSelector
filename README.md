# ReactColorComponentSelector

Color selector changes the Background color of a component using useState Hook, react-color and CSS modules

I just wanted to practice what i've learn about react framework. It's not great (no responsive yet) but for me it is a big achieve and a close approach for what i wanted to do. 

Thanks you much to Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller (a wonderful teacher) and Academind team
